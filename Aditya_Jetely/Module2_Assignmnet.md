1.In this module I learnt about the general definition of Machine Learning which is :- 

Machine learning is a subset of (AI) that provides machines the ability to learn and improve from past experiences without being explicitly programmed.

<br>
2. I also learned about the three categories in which Machine learning can be divided which are :-

i) Supervised Learning
> In supervised learning we have labelled data and as the name suggests it has a supervisor. 

ii) Unsupervised Learning
> Here the data is unlabelled hence we have to calculate similarity measures among features, no supervisor is present in this case.

iii) Reinforcement Learning
> This is like a reward based system where the model is rewarded on the basis of the performance of the algorithm.

<br>
3. I also learned in depth about the various algorithms associated with supervised and unsupervised learning including their applications, importance and disadvantages, some of these algorithms were:-

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest 
- Support Vector Machines

<br>
4. I also learned about various Classifier evaluation metrices.

- Linear Regressiom is one of the most easy to understand as well beginner friendly Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
- The main idea behind linear regression is to form an equation which depicts a realtion between one or more than one independent variables and the dependent variable.The dependent variable can also be called as the target because that is the one whose value we are going to predict in the end.
- When only one independent variable is present then the linear regression is called simple linear regression otherwise it is called Multiple Linear Regression.

### Advantages of Linear Regresssion

- One of the key avantage of linear regression is its simplicity, interpretability and scientific acceptance.
- It is one of the very first ml algorithm that most people use hence it is beginner friendly.

### Applications of Linear Regression

- Predicitng values
- Forecasting
- Error Reduction
 
 
 ### Example use case of Linear Regression
 
 For example if you have a dataset in which the no of hours a student studies and the marks they obtain is given .Then we can train a model using Linear Regression and predict the marks obtained by some student whose study hours have been provided to us.
