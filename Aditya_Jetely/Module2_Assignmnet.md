1.In this module I learnt about the general definition of Machine Learning which is :- 

Machine learning is a subset of (AI) that provides machines the ability to learn and improve from past experiences without being explicitly programmed.

<br>
2. I also learned about the three categories in which Machine learning can be divided which are :-

i) Supervised Learning
> In supervised learning we have labelled data and as the name suggests it has a supervisor. 

ii) Unsupervised Learning
> Here the data is unlabelled hence we have to calculate similarity measures among features, no supervisor is present in this case.

iii) Reinforcement Learning
> This is like a reward based system where the model is rewarded on the basis of the performance of the algorithm.

<br>
3. I also learned in depth about the various algorithms associated with supervised and unsupervised learning, some of these algorithms were:-

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest 
- Support Vector Machines

<br>
4. I also learned about various Classifier evaluation metrices.
